Iâ€™m a Product Manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. I have worked at the Ministry of Defence, Department of Health (before it became DHSC), Department for Work and Pensions and for UK Parliament.

Before Parliament and Government I studied at the University of Sheffield, Tsinghua University and the University of Southampton. I've lived and worked in Korea and China. Born in Newcastle and raised mostly in Nortumberland.
