# January exercise challenge
Yes, it's another lockdown. Regardless, I’m still trying to keep the mind and body in good shape. This month [inspired by an exercise challenge](https://www.greatrun.org/virtual-running/january-accumulator-challenge/), I committed myself to doing 21 or more activities. 

Could be anything from:
- walking
- running
- yoga
- paragliding

## Did I conquer the challenge?
Yep. By my count I squeezed in 24 activities over the month. There was snow, ice, rain, a brutal pandemic, hailstorms but that couldn’t stop me.

### Show me the evidence
This is what I did…

#### What activities?
I got through:

<iframe title="[ Count of exercise activities]" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-UdQyy" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UdQyy/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="239"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

#### Totals & averages
Exercising:
- Total miles: 65.77 miles. Yoga isn’t helping this. 
- Average distance from running & walking: 5.06 miles

Time:
- Total time taken: 22.49 hours
- Average exercise time: 56.23 minutes

#### What else?
Facts and figures:
- longest distance was 16.55 miles
- lowest distance was 2.53 mile walk
- fastest run was 8.26 minutes per mile, not terrible given the conditions I was running in

## Perspective
I saw this morning that the quite frankly incredible Eddie Izzard is finishing off a marathon a day this month with an ultramarathon (plus doing a stand-up gig everyday).

By my count he has done about 838.4 miles this month. I did about 7.8% of what Eddie has done… yikes! Such an amazing achievement.

## What next?
Have enjoyed getting into balancing out the type of exercise and not being so running heavy. I think it’s been a wise move given the weather and pandemic but also the yoga has helped with all those work from home aches and pains. Will try to continue this for Feb.
