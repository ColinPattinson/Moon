# Great North Run Solo
I'm a Geordie and have a strong affection towards the Great North Run. I've cheered my grandfather on as a bairn and even participated a few years ago.

Well this year, on it's 40th anniversary, it's had to pivot in the wake of the c-word. As such [they've went virtual](https://www.greatrun.org/virtual-running/great-north-run)!

Partner and I have signed up to both support a fine cause but get out in the sunshine and get some vital exercise in lockdown life. Only thing is this means I've got a challenge on my hands. 40 runs in 73 days (stipulation of the 40th anniversary of the race). I've also got a choice of trying to do a total of either 100 miles or 200 miles over those 40 runs - at the moment I'm on an average distance of 4.85 miles per run but need to up it to 5.025 to make the 200 mark. This post will give you a glimpse at progress.

## Progress as of 7th of July
