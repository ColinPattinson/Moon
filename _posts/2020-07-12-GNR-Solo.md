# Great North Run Solo
I'm doing the Great North Run Solo! It would of been the Great North Run's 40th anniversary this year but due to the c-word it has had to pivot and now [they've went virtual](https://www.greatrun.org/virtual-running/great-north-run)!

Partner and I have signed up to get out in the sunshine and get some vital exercise in lockdown life. Only thing is this means I've got a challenge on my hands. 40 runs in 73 days (stipulation of the 40th anniversary of the race). I've also made the choice to go for the 'silver' medal and try do a total of 200 miles over those 40 runs.

## Cool, so what?
It's nice to have a physical goal after months of lockdown and I suppose as a Geordie I have some affinity towards the Great North Run. I remember cheering my grandfather on as a bairn while he was out running it, I still own a couple of his winners t-shirts from before I was born and even participated a few years ago.

I'm also keeping a fairly structured bit of data on every run - not dissimilar to keeping a [fantastically fastidious account of a coffee club I put together at my old job](https://colinpattinson.github.io/NHSX-updates-7/). The culmination I am hoping will be some data as art - inspired by [observe, collect, draw](http://giorgialupi.com/observe-collect-draw). Watch this space...

### Progress as of 2nd of August
Good news is that i'm 40% of the way through. That comprises of 15 runs and 1 long hike. I'm in two minds if this is in the spirit of the race but I was on holiday and got insanely soaked on the walk so for the time being i'm allowing it.

#### Show me the evidence...
Below is a little chart with run distance and date of run. I'm mostly sticking to a regime of a longer run at the weekend then runs after work on weekdays.

<iframe title="Great North Virtual Runs" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-TF0zC" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TF0zC/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="231"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

I can tell you that I've also;
- done 82.17 miles so far
- my runs are an average distance of 5.135625 miles
- I am aiming for the 200 mile mark so that leaves me _only_ 117.83 miles to go
- with each run needing to be at least an average length of 4.909583333 miles
- my pace is a little all over the place but is currently at an average of 9.297333333 mins per mile - i've discounted the hike!

##### Any other news?
The only other news is, as of today, I'm retiring my New Balance running shoes. They've seen me through many miles, including... unbelievably... one marathon. A hole in the toe area has appeared and the cushioning is not what it once was. So i've invested in some new Brooks shoes to see me through the final 60% and beyond. You did well trainers...
