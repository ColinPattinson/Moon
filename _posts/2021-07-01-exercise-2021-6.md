# June exercise report
[Mayâ€™s report](https://colinpattinson.github.io/exercise-2021-5/) saw me cycle to Loch Ness. Juneâ€™s saw 3 hikes. Which is pretty cool. One up in Scotland, one down on the south coast and the other in a part of London Iâ€™ve not seen before.

## Context
Was up and down the island this month. Even got on a plane which is wild. Didnâ€™t stop me stretching my legs though...

### Activities 
This is what I didâ€¦

#### What activities?
This month included:

</script>

24 activities in 30 days. Less than last month. Lots of the stats are down. The hiking might of taken its toll.

#### Totals & averages
Exercising:
- total miles: 149.55 miles 
- in 2021 I have now racked up 859 miles

Time:
- total time taken: 29 hours 03 minutes. 
- average exercise time: 73.3 minutes. Way up from last months 54.5 minutes. Very likely the hiking skewing the numbers here.

#### What else?
Facts and figures:
- longest distance was a 13.98 mile hike doing the [Seven Sisters walk](https://www.walkingclub.org.uk/walk/seaford-to-eastbourne/)
- lowest distance was a 2.84 mile walk 
- fastest run was 1 second faster than last month with a 7.07 minutes per mile effort. 

## Perspective
Conscious that Iâ€™ve now done x6 of these, which is mildly preposterous. Having [weeknoted for a decent stretch](https://colinpattinson.github.io/tags/#Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Social%20Care) in a row and now also having celebrated x26 weekly recorded show and tells at work I have a knack of being persistent. I believe I started to keep myself motivated, focused and healthy - through a [form of public commitment](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-rule-of-commitment-2795890). Iâ€™ve gotten this far, it seems to be working, so going for the full year. 

As a little clue about how much progress Iâ€™ve made here is a mini 6 month reportâ€¦

</script>

## What next?
I hope I get to hang out with as many 4 legged friends this month. Had a [great hike with Oscar the dog](https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/1400763600143360003) up a Scottish mountain at the start and even was in a farm at one pointâ€¦

Will be on a mini adventure mid this month so I will take the running shoes and see if I can crank out some extra miles.
