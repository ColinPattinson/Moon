# October accumulator challenge
I’ve done [another running challenge](https://www.greatrun.org/virtual-running/accumulator/october). This one Halloween themed, running from ghouls and all that jazz.

This time the challenge included:
- From the 1st of October, complete a minimum of 15 runs by October 31st
- run 40 miles total
- there is an optional checklist which includes running through a graveyard & to howl like a wolf while running - I just saw this as I am writing this… so needless to say… I didn’t do this. Sorry.

## Did I conquer the challenge?
Yeah. Done and dusted.

![Digital certificate for the run which explains I have completed the 15 runs and ran 56.1 miles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/master/assets/img/October%20run%20certificate.jpeg)

### Show me the evidence
15 runs and 56.1 miles done total. Average distance 3.738666667 miles per run as you can see below…

</script>

Average pace per mile is massive because it includes one long hike at 9.779072319 per mile.

</script>

Roughly (rounded up times) it was a total of 10 hours and 37 minutes out and about exercising.

#### What else?
Facts and figures…
- longest distance was 8.02 miles
- lowest distance was 2.79 miles
- fastest was my last run at 8.24 minutes per mile
- runs occurred in 2 different countries
- I want to reiterate that I never howled like a wolf while I was running. I did listen to an unholy amount of songs of which I may of passionately blasted out to myself while I out & about

## What next?
Had international travel not been banned & certain life events blocking me I might have already been doing an ultra marathon in Hawaii but sadly not quite yet. It will stay on the to do list. 

What I know is that running is good for the noggin, so if you see me out on the streets and I scamper by then be sure to honk + wave.
