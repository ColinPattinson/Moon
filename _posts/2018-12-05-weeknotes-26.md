# Weeknotes E26
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. Each week I’m going to keep a running update of the work I’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

## My current priority:
> Supporting the Healthy Start private beta.

## Wednesday
- First day back after 3+ weeks of leave
- retro and sprint planning
- find out that people are leaving : ( but also new people are joining : )
- read some really nice feedback from our Product People event which [Dharmesh](https://twitter.com/dharmz23) and I organised: “Just wanted to say how useful I found the last Meet Up, the speakers were excellent and the presentation of NHS work was very relevant to my own project.
The best compliment I can give is that I actually understood the presentations and could follow the Q and A……..which itself is a benefit I feel from being part of this network, I wouldn’t have understood most of what was said only 6 months ago.”
- fighting the cause for service registers again and making ongoing research and dev work in Gov publically available
- [improving evaluation of health and care blog](https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2018/11/28/improving-the-evaluation-of-digital-public-health/). Also making sure the team is in the room for extremely relevant events going on inside DHSC.
- changing my email address. Hello @dhsc.gov.uk
- commenting on a future service manual page
- emailing the [Childhood Obesity Trailblazer Programme](https://www.local.gov.uk/childhood-obesity-trailblazer-programme). Sounds really cool!
- updated requirements for pre-paid card
- more [x-org collab](https://twitter.com/tanjacwalsh/status/1067829005821325315), or trying to do at least.

## Thursday
- requesting [pa11y](http://pa11y.org/), all in the name of automated accessibility testing
- chat with new team member about user recruitment for healthy start beta (when can I start using the new name?)
- planning with healthy start
- catch up with Suzanne
- vitamins catch up with Sam. Discovery is coming!

## Friday
- setting up pre-paid card day
- learning about health and benefits service community. The ravages of poverty extends even further than health and benefits.
- discussions with finance team and how DHSC are going to pay for pre-paid cards/keep them topped up
- emailing the Scottish gov user researcher working on best start. Must collab, so much to learn from one another
- emailed the [data as culture team](https://theodi.org/service/data-as-culture/) at the Open Data Institute. I don’t have anything really to offer but loved the idea we could bring some thought provoking art to DHSC about health/wellbeing and data.
- most of afternoon was sifting through 27 job applications for associate delivery role. Lots to read through but amazing number of applications!

## Monday
- Xmas party food booking - team is max-Festive
- long workshop on measuring success
- finally cleaned my locker. This might sound small but now my brain doesn’t hurt everytime I open my locker
- sifting chat about the delivery manager job. Some great candidates
- using this Crown Commercial Agreement to find a [prepaid card partner](https://ccs-agreements.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/contracts/rm3828)

## Tuesday
- commenting on Healthy Start user research plan
- meeting with Lauren, new DM in the team, tapping up for vitamins discovery
- discussion about pre-paid card day plans and trying to setup the day
- went to a child mental health event, showing findings from a set of reports
- went to a discussion about a family/social media/mental health tool. Gave constructive advice

## What I've been reading
1. BBC article on [incentivising people to be healthier](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46365083). I would put £2 on that those that want an Apple watch are already inclined to exercise in the first place.
2. The allure of [health and social care for apprentices](https://feweek.co.uk/2018/10/25/apprenticeships-by-industry-characteristics-data-the-5-things-we-learnt) and the North-East lagging behind.
3. Opinion piece on the [internet splintering into 3](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/internet-google-china-balkanization.html) (yes, 3 not 2)... US, China & Europe.
4. Instagram's [harassment problem](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/instagram-has-massive-harassment-problem/572890/).
5. Gritty, an NHL mascot, [becomes a meme](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46372908).
6. Buzzfeed reports [‘how we radicalised the world’](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-facebook-elections) especially on the backs of Silicon Valley giants
7. Government’s failure to [capitalise on open data](https://www.ft.com/content/f8e9c2ea-b29b-11e8-87e0-d84e0d934341). Good quote; “The regulation [for open data in the UK] is there but not the checks. It’s like having a speed limit, but no police on the road and no monitoring.”
8. Walmart sued for [inaccessible self-service machines](https://nfb.org/walmart-sued-blind-maryland-residents-over-self-service-checkout-kiosks)
