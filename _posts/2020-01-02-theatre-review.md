# Theatre Year End Review
It’s a real privilege to have so much theatre on your doorstep. I’ve always been keen on theatre trips since moving to London - you can see loads of great stuff and you can get great value for money seats if you are happy sitting in some of the restricted view seats. Which I am... a handsome pillar blocking 9% of my view has yet to spoil the show.

In 2019, my partner and I saw 20 theatre productions. A slight dip from 23 in 2018 but we went to Edinburgh Fringe that year so bunched up a lot of shows in the same day.

After each show we’d grade what we thought of the show. Here is our list and badly remembered reviews :)

## Rankings
1) Six, A grade

![Six poster](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Six_Musical.jpg/220px-Six_Musical.jpg)

The concept is “a modern retelling of the lives of the six wives of Henry VIII presented as a pop concert, as the wives take turns singing and telling their story to see who suffered the most due to Henry and should therefore become the group's lead singer” ( [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_(musical)) ).

It was in sum absolutely fabulous, with a cracking soundtrack. Uplifting and empowering I’d highly recommend catching it.

2) A very expensive poison, A-

The Old Vic puts on great stuff and this was a real blast. Moving, funny and entertaining. It’s about an assassination but don’t want to reveal much more as it’s best to go into this unknowing.

3) War of the Worlds immersive experience, A-

This was a bday present. Part performance, part immersion, part VR. It was both hilarious and at some parts thrilling. Might be a bit niche but I adore the Jeff Wayne soundtrack and the theming was top notch. See [more about it here](https://www.dotdot.london/).
 
4) The Cursed Child (both parts in a day), B+

It was magical, downside might of been the seats needed magnifying glasses.

5) Midsummers Night Dream ([Bridge theatre production](https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/a-midsummer-nights-dream/)), B+

Love these Bridge theatre Shakespeare productions, saw Julius Caesar in 2018 too which was fab. This was fun, got to sing along to Beyonce and Bottom was the most entertaining character.

6) Fleabag, B+

Felt like an event.

7) Small Island, B+

Great stage setup, moving. I think a tiny bit of drag in the second half dropped the score of what would of been much higher.

8) Fairview, B

Provocative in all the right ways. I was moved might have benefitted from a little editing in the middle act.

9) All about Eve, B

Worst seats of the year but good play.

10) School of Rock, B-

Cheesy but fun. Saw it in a snowstorm with family.

11) All my sons, C+

Moody, with Bill Pullman.

12) Motown the musical, C+

Great seats, songs you probably have heard and like before. Not much else.

13) Alys, Always, C+

Thriller that was good entertainment - no longer remember why it scored so low.

14) Fiddler on the roof, C+

TRADITION! TRADITION! I think I enjoyed it more than my partner.

15) Betrayal, C

Sparse design, good performances. Nothing bad to say.

16) Death of a Salesman, C

Expected a bit more.

17) Twilight Zone, C-

Utter tosh. Entertainingly bad, I haven't seen the TV show but this was silly. I still laugh at silly things.

18) Jesus Hopped the A Train, C-

Stage design is very interesting. Performances mostly great, I think 1-2 of the characters we couldn't get on board with.

19) The American Clock, D+

I enjoyed it but partner hated. I think I enjoy things set during the Great Depression but that's not for some.

20) I’m Not Running, D

A David Hare play about junior doctors, Parliament, politics, NHS and i’ sure there was even some of it set in Newcastle. It should of been a smash. Instead we both found it boring. It felt a decade too late and left feeling disappointed. I have seen worse in other years though so it’s not rock bottom by any means.

## Fave theatre visited this year
![Bridge Theatre from the outside](https://d2qqnmbwcdc6ya.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/08181058/Bridge-Theatre-Exterior.jpg)
I really enjoy the [Bridge Theatre](https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/). It often has great varied productions, the space is often radically transformed for each production and every seat I’ve had I thought was well priced. If you haven't you should.

## 2020
We’ve got a fair few theatre trips already booked in for 2020. Here is a bunch i’m excited for;
- [& Juliet](http://www.shaftesburytheatre.com/shows/juliet/)
- [The Book of Dust](https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/la-belle-sauvage/)
- [The Effect](https://boulevardtheatre.co.uk/whats-on/the-effect/)

## Other end of year reviews
My partner wrote a much better [post about our food adventures in 2019](https://medium.com/@gemmarogers1/eating-out-in-2019-the-best-and-worst-places-695190011f0c?). You should check it out.
