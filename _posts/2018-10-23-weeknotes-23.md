# Weeknotes E23
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. Each week I’m going to keep a running update of the work I’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

## My current priority:
> Helping to procure a team capable of delivering the Healthy Start private beta.

## Wednesday
- retrospective time
- planning for the next sprint
- getting help from procurement team for future pre-paid card procurement task
- was a user research participant, fun to be on the other side of user research
- helping PHE team with some resources that explain RCTs without using copy
- did some research into merchant IDs - these are things that help us to potentially restrict where you could use a pre-paid card
- [SoS vision was published](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-healthcare-our-vision-for-digital-data-and-technology-in-health-and-care/the-future-of-healthcare-our-vision-for-digital-data-and-technology-in-health-and-care). Not every suggestion I contributed made it but I see bits of my input. That is rewarding. Next is delivery...
- public health interventions show and tell
- created a reading list for suppliers (*contract pending) all about Healthy Start so they can get up to speed asap
- getting Sam (new colleague) up to speed with a potential vitamins discovery

## Thursday
- Talk to Frank alpha spend control form
- connecting CCS and DHSC procurement teams so we are all onboard the pre-paid card procurement train
- Healthy Start phone chat. Chat about our proposed inception phase with suppliers, vitamins, contracts, pre-paid cards.
- content crit and giving comments for an NHS Digital document
- Vitamins chat. Colleague Katie wants to be involved. The team grows further.
- discussion about working with policy professionals and how best to support them
- Healthy Start planning
- digging through the CCS pre-paid card terms and conditions. Enlightening!
- selling my yoga spot in November. Holiday alert, making plans.
- made another presentation for suppliers about recent experiment done by team in Cardiff on using vouchers for non-eligible items
- emailed the person that did the research to get more info and see if they’d like to potentially reproduce the experiment but with cards!

## Friday
- finding old [Healthy Start research](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/216866/DH-template-retailer-research-FINAL1.pdf)
- doing the departments people survey - i said i was happy about most things.
- organise Vitamins discovery mini-chat
- mid-year review
- went to cross-Gov product unconference. [Marty Cagan](https://twitter.com/cagan?lang=en) spoke - nodded in agreement with most of what he said. Basically hire competent people who are not toxic and empower them to solve problems.

## Monday
- had an interview for an internal Civil Service scheme, never sure how these things go. Feels like I always have more to say. Was honest though so don’t think it went terribly.
- sitting with Healthy Start team going through tasks
- emailed and chased a bunch of people for answers to questions
- cycled over to see PHE crew and did a workshop with academics and team in the ‘measuring success of public health interventions’ work. Was fun. Like helping others and team.
- had a call with NHSBSA colleague. Sooooo kind and nice. Extremely helpful Geordie who talked us through tips and experience of getting a pre-paid card provider. One takeaway is to include in the contract that the supplier updates you about innovations in the space. So if they can produce a new version of the card which is better for users, better for the environment or cheaper then we can capitalise on it.
- read through future healthy start blog and made comments
- forwarded on reading materials that were unearthed for vitamins discovery
- discussing which platform we should use to blog

## Tuesday
- did some 360 feedback for a colleague
- wrote a justification email about going to the [Responsible Tech conference](https://doteveryone.org.uk/responsible-tech-2019/). Sounds right up my street.
- healthy start phone chat, updating team on great chat with NHSBSA
- on a call with DWP team researching healthy start awareness/signposting
- doing arts and crafts to create a physical board full of Brexit tasks
- going through survey results, 64 participants - ace!
- updated presentation and wrote first draft of blog to accompany results

## What I've been reading
1. [Tim BL shares his vision for improving the web](https://medium.com/@timberners_lee/one-small-step-for-the-web-87f92217d085). I’m in Tim! Love the sound of a personal online data store.
2. [FT with an interesting article on the history and importance of booze](https://amp.ft.com/content/c5ce0834-9a64-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d) and its positive health ramifications if done in moderation. 
3. Well told story on [advocating for interoperability in the world of health and social care services](https://vix.digital/insights/interoperability-saves-lives/), specifically the ambulance services.
4. A long post on [getting better data in healthcare](https://wardle.org/strategy/2018/08/30/algorithm-strategy.html) with Wardley maps to sink your teeth into.
5. The [story of London Bridge moving to Arizona](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/the_bridge_that_crossed_an_ocean). Lovely photo essay.
6. Life expectancy [numbers are falling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45638646). Punishing [effects of loneliness](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/25/loneliness-among-over-50s-is-looming-public-health-concern) also making the news.
7. Ex-colleague Michael discussing the [perils of whittling down to atomised user needs](http://smethur.st/posts/176135868). Michael’s a fabulous communicator when inspired to do so. Always worth readings/listening to even if you don’t agree with every opinion.
8. Got a job recently... Want a bump up in the pay offer - [there might be tools out there to help](https://www.ft.com/content/bc4a060a-7e08-11e8-af48-190d103e32a4).Article reports that 50% of men and 70% of women don’t even bother to negotiate at all.
