# March exercise report
Still keeping track of activities, the [February report exists if interested](https://colinpattinson.github.io/exercise-2021-2/). Had some holiday this month and managed to get out a bit more as spring begins to rear its head. Record setting month.

## Context
My watch/activity tracker is having issues this month. So I might be under reporting but Iâ€™ve done my best. Bike also got some TLC this month so I've been cycling a bit more.

### Activities 
This is what I didâ€¦

#### What activities?
I got through:

<iframe title="Count of activity" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-6UYKT" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6UYKT/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="314"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

34 activities in 31 days. 4 more than last month. I also think slightly under reported too.

Youâ€™ll notice the new activity this monthâ€¦

Got a new racket. Loved getting out there. I haven't really played tennis since about 2014-15. I never had itâ€¦ so not noticing much of a drop off!

#### Totals & averages
Exercising:
- total miles: 105.58 miles 
- quite remarkable given last month was 51.64 miles - i blame all the cycling
- I returned to a HIIT class after my run in with Joe Wicks last month. No injury to report
- in 2021 Iâ€™m already getting very close to surpassing 250 miles

Time:
- total time taken: 26.4 hours
- up from last month by over an hour
- average exercise time: 46.5 minutes

#### What else?
Facts and figures:
- longest distance was 15.41 mile cycle ride
- lowest distance was 2.23 mile walk - i have a feeling Iâ€™ve missed some small lunchtime walks 
- fastest run was 8.06 minutes per mile and it happened twice. Which is not bad given I have London traffic to contend with and having to wait at traffic lights. An 8min mile pace is a good threshold as usually means you could crank out a 1 hour 45 min half marathon time.

## Perspective
As a fan of [Empire of the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Sun), I felt drawn to read [They Called Us Enemy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/george-takei-has-talked-about-his-familys-internment-before-but-never-quite-like-this/2019/07/11/f3320c6e-a3fd-11e9-b732-41a79c2551bf_story.html). It is touching and beautiful and highly recommended!

## What next?
Would be great to squeeze in more tennis. I still harbour ambitions to do a half marathon this year (ideally with people and timed rather than just tracking it myself) so might try a few more longer runs in prep for a future Iâ€™d like to make happen :)
