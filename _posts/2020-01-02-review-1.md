# Theatre
It’s a real privilege to have so much theatre on your doorstep. I’ve always been keen on theatre trips since moving to London - you can see loads of great stuff and you can get great value for money seats if you are happy sitting in some of the restricted view seats.

In 2019, my partner and I saw 20 theatre productions. After each we’d grade what we thought of the show. Here is our list :)

## Rankings
1) Six, A grade

![Six poster](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Six_Musical.jpg/220px-Six_Musical.jpg)

The concept is “a modern retelling of the lives of the six wives of Henry VIII presented as a pop concert, as the wives take turns singing and telling their story to see who suffered the most due to Henry and should therefore become the group's lead singer” ( [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_(musical)) ).

It was in sum absolutely fabulous, with a cracking soundtrack. Uplifting and empowering I’d highly recommend catching it.

2) A very expensive poison, A-
The Old Vic puts on great stuff and this was a real blast. Moving, funny and entertaining. It’s about an assassination but don’t want to reveal much more as it’s best to go into this unknowing.

3) War of the Worlds immersive experience, A-
This was a bday present. Part performance, part immersion, part VR. It was both hilarious and at some parts thrilling. Might be a bit niche but I adore the Jeff Wayne soundtrack and the theming was top notch. See [more about it here](https://www.dotdot.london/).
 
4) The Cursed Child, B+

5) Midsummers Night Dream ([Bridge theatre production](https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/a-midsummer-nights-dream/)), B+

6) Fleabag, B+

7) Small Island, B+

8) Fairview, B

9) All about Eve, B

10) School of Rock, B-

11) All my sons, C+

12) Motown the musical, C+

13) Alys, Always, C+

14) Fiddler on the roof, C+

15) Betrayal, C

16) Death of a Salesmen, C

17) Twilight Zone, C-

18) Jesus Hopped the A Train, C-

19) The American Clock, D+

20) I’m Not Running, D
A David Hare play about jnr doctors, Parliament, politics, NHS and i’ sure there was even some of it set in Newcastle. It should of been a smash. Instead we both found it boring. It felt a decade too late and left feeling disappointed. I have seen worse in other years though so it’s not rock bottom by any means.

## Fave theatre visited this year
![Bridge Theatre from the outside](https://d2qqnmbwcdc6ya.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/08181058/Bridge-Theatre-Exterior.jpg)
I really enjoy the [Bridge Theatre](https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/). It often has great varied productions, the space is often radically transformed for each production and every seat I’ve had I thought was well priced. 

## 2020
We’ve got a fair few theatre trips already booked in for 2020. Here is a bunch i’m excited for;
- [& Juliet](http://www.shaftesburytheatre.com/shows/juliet/)
