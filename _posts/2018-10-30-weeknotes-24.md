# Weeknotes E24
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. Each week I’m going to keep a running update of the work I’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

## My current priority:
> Helping to procure a team capable of delivering the Healthy Start private beta.

## Wednesday
- trying to get our team off and running writing sprint updates
- adding to user research plans and going through the DWP discussion guide for testing in November! Exciting!!
- Said hi to Matt Hancock who visited the team briefly
- promoting product people event
- saying we should change name
- doing more mid-year review work
- agreeing to run retro for tech vision next week
- digging into more MI data
- tried to download both R, GOV.UK prototyping Kit and power bi - non worked.
- long 1 to 1. Wide ranging chat and always constructive

## Thursday
- sending more resources to future supplier
- creating materials for vitamins discovery chat
- seeing the inception agenda and making comments/assigning tasks
- afternoon meeting with vitamins stakeholder and pitching a discovery
- learning a ton about vitamins and connecting people together so we can kick off work
- agreeing the support needed to make vitamins happen
- learning about [NHS glasses](https://www.college-optometrists.org/asset/1F817410-F4C5-4F47-B35897F66D80446A/200x286-highestPerformance/)
- emailed someone to contribute to the aging society grand challenge the Prime Minister set. Changing society for the 100 year life is fascinating.

## Friday
- xmas planning for team, know any good places?
- helping colleague to add to speaking notes for a future event - bigging up the article suggesting [patient needs isn’t the whole picture](https://medium.com/doteveryone/putting-users-first-is-not-the-answer-to-everything-dd05b9f11b5)
- call with PHE and maternity transformation work. A lot of collaboration feels on the cards
- made a quick guide to what private beta and public beta is to explain to suppliers
- been updating and compiling resources for my sessions to get suppliers up and running
- spend control discussions, still on that train encouraging people to research with the people that will actually use their intended service
- finding NHS.UK content people
- adding more stuff to presentations for new team - this time recommendations from Healthy Start report
- went to GP, he remembered me from last time and asked about my recent half marathon - excellent service

## Monday
- back to the GP, person at reception said I didn’t have the necessary form I needed and was a bit gruff. Not so-excellent service
- sending images of prototype to help user researcher from DWP team
- sending out constructive advice on doing user research for a team that want to buy something in the world of dentistry
- emailing a new person that is working on Redbook. Trying to raise awareness of Healthy Start
- trying to make an uptake map happen with the fine help of colleague Isaac
- blog post editing
- blog post writing
- blog platform acquiring (spoiler: despite efforts we got denied and someone snr in GDS thought we’d give up writing weekly updates and get bored of it like more teams in their experience… I shall prove them wrong)

## Tuesday
- spent the morning with PHE crew on measuring the success of public health interventions. Healthy Start team were guinea pigs going through logic models, journey maps and some other post-it note grid that nobody had a name for. Was great at highlighting that our aim is to improve the identified health outcomes. Still work to do with how teams can make that happen.
- call with lady in Cardiff who ran the mystery shopper exercise for healthy start. Excellent chat, great to share and more collaboration in the future!
- supplier (*contract pending) sent the names of new team members. Will search for every single one on Google tomorrow.
- chatting about what level of assessment the PHE work should get. 
- connecting all the vitamin related chats to vitamin discovery head honcho - Sam
- Isaac and I chatting about his progress with mapping uptake stats to a map of local authorities
- digging in management info data, I spotted errors and got a cleaned up spreadsheet to continue to dig
- still trying to work out where our blog/sprint notes are going to live
- hr battles

## What I've been reading
1. How [pockets on jeans are unequal](https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/). Excellent use of data and visualising evidence. 
2. As Facebook launches a dating service [another study delves into online dating](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/news/releases/new-study-reveals-changing-trends-in-online-dating) (a topic I am fascinated by).
3. Great [set of tools to steal from the ODI](https://theodi.org/article/creators-of-tools-for-open-data-steal-this) to help you publish your data. Also [NIHR publishing open data](https://theodi.org/article/an-open-future-how-the-national-institute-for-health-research-is-opening-up-data) is wonderful.
4. How to [fall asleep in 120 seconds](https://medium.com/s/story/combat-tested-training-unwind-and-sleep-anywhere-in-120-seconds-27d5307b7606) - i have not tried this.
5. Excellence guidance/principles on [Internet-era ways of working](https://public.digital/2018/10/12/internet-era-ways-of-working/).
6. [Local gov ideas on designing services with accountability](https://medium.com/@mcaino/towards-end-to-end-local-services-not-transactions-a607b5d55ba9). Based on the [fantastic 2016 work](https://blog.memespring.co.uk/2016/11/23/oscon-2016/) which is 100% worth reading.
7. How to [create a triple storyline](https://medium.com/mule-design/a-three-part-plan-to-save-the-world-98653a20a12f) - a way to visualise journey maps that are good for users, the business and the world.
8. When designing internal software, don’t go wild. [Re-use what we expect the public to use](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/02/why-re-use-is-the-best-design-because-civil-servants-are-users-too/).
