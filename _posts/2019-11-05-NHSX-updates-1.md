# Weeknotes Reminder!
![Colin and colleague are creating a user journey map with post it notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhsx/Mental-Health/master/images/Mapping.jpg)

We've finished discovery and this is a short post to both celebrate and remind of where to find more info! (Before purdah begins tomorrow!)

Team and myself have been dedicating a lot of time to keeping stakeholders updated via weeknotes. You can see them all over at [NHSX Mental Health github pages](https://nhsx.github.io/Mental-Health/).

# What next
We got a lot of positive feedback on our updates. Such as...
> "Thanks for circulating this update. Helpful to absorb the key information quickly."

I think we are all geared up for more when the next phase of work begins. They've been a great way to keep people updated and a resource to point at when people ask about our work. More to come, watch this space!
