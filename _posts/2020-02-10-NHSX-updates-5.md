Colleagues and myself have been thinking about how to make the tech ecosystem in the NHS more sustainable. This is an update on what we‚Äôve been doing. 

[There are two previous posts on this topic](https://colinpattinson.github.io/tags/#Climate).

# Event
I attended an event called [OneGreenGov](https://medium.com/oneteamgov/announcing-a-one-green-gov-event-6e8c91f43429). It‚Äôs goal was for participants;

> to learn more and take practical action to make a difference for our planet in their community, job, or home life.

This post is a set of reflections and snippets I learned on the day (lots of people spoke in great depth about subjects but i‚Äôm only picking out bits and bobs!).

## GDS colleagues
- civil servant colleagues talked about how we [already have a mandate to act in the digital, data, tech and climate space](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/greening-government-commitments). It‚Äôs not something we should be hesitant of and it is our responsibility
- talk of our ability to set standards or tackling the issue through things like GovTech catalyst
-  civil service has a large footprint and buying power (332,800 in England) - if we make progress then can make a real difference. _The NHS has about 1.187 million employees - so does that make NHS's responsibility over x3 as much?_
- heard about a carbon calculator prototype. Found out a little more later in the week‚Ä¶

## Design and climate
I‚Äôve been very interested in this topic from a design angle. It‚Äôs not all hardware and behaviour. Next up was someone from [Snook](https://wearesnook.com/) who shared (a tiny tiny selection);
- 6 meet-ups organised last year, interested in the practice of designing sustainably - _reminder to self I need to dig more into this_
- ‚ÄúAccountability‚Äù needs to be our word for 2020. Need to see design with a climate lens.
- [NHS responsible for 5.4% of UK‚Äôs greenhouse gases](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/18/hospitals-planet-health-anaesthetic-gases-electric-ambulances-dialysis-nhs-carbon-footprint)

## DEFRA‚Äôs permanent secretary
Former DHSC colleague spoke more about what DEFRA are doing in this space;

## Midday Musings
I went to a handful of sessions around midday. Here are some scattergun reflections;
- heard about the [sustainable web manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com). [Blog post about it](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/introducing-the-sustainable-web-manifesto/) also reveals more info.
- [Website carbon calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com) (a few of these knocking about) - _I tested the NHSX website out of interest, [cleaner than 70% of websites tested but improvements can be made](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/nhsx-nhs-uk/)_
- how might we invest in and support growth of companies working to be climate resilient but also accept this won‚Äôt be seamless and not an easy task
- big problem like this requires system thinkers, designers and great communicators
- [Office for Environmental Protection is coming](https://deframedia.blog.gov.uk/2019/10/16/new-office-for-environmental-protection-will-ensure-governments-maintain-green-credentials/) and has the power to ensure governments maintain green credentials
- [UN goals, one being climate action](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030-goal13.html)
- heard about the [SCATTER tool which looks brilliant](https://scattercities.com/). A free tool that uses ‚Äúscience-based targets to help local authorities calculate their carbon budget and cut their emissions in line with climate science‚Äù 

## Sir David King
Really really really enjoyed [Sir David King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_King_(chemist)) lecture. He touched upon/made me think about;
- that a warming world is without doubt a health crisis. He worked on responses to the [2003 heat wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_European_heat_wave) which may have killed 50,000 - 70,000 people. Even more terrifying is that without intervention these dangerously hot temperatures will become the norm. By 2045 they could be our average temperature.
- [Kolkata is at risk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/kolkata-india-climate-change-casuality-coastal-flooding-ganges-a8479516.html) and human migration due to the climate change is already happening, [even in the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/this-is-a-wake-up-call-the-villagers-who-could-be-britains-first-climate-refugees).
- his speech was really motivating - a brilliant way to end the day

# What next?
Myself and colleagues have been shaping and moulding our pitch for a future event, good news is we are all ready to roll. We‚Äôve also been chasing opportunities which have been fruitful. Feels like we can make a valuable impact, now just need to find more time to work on it.

# Further reading
Interesting extras for those who may want to know more:
- I had not heard of the [lite version of CNN](http://lite.cnn.io/en) - it‚Äôs a version of CNN for those with internet connection issues (e.g. those in a hurricane who need access to vital info but don‚Äôt have access to a fast connection). Also a [text only NPR service exists](https://text.npr.org/). 
- I‚Äôve not dug into everything but Snook have [been writing about this topic and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs worth a read](https://wearesnook.com/design-like-theres-a-climate-crisis/)
- some talk of rewilding. [Visited Knepp farm last year](https://knepp.co.uk/home), which was wonderful. Worth a visit if interested in topic.
- while on a short trip the [NHS made some green commitment announcements](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/01/greener-nhs-campaign-to-tackle-climate-health-emergency/)!
